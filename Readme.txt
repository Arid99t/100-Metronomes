You will take on the role of a metronome, leading an ensemble of 97 metronomes from chaotic rhythms to a gradually unified rhythm. 


We offers three BPMs (Beats Per Minute) and three Alpha levels (this parameter determines your ability to guide the metronomes) along with four different guiding methods. Please select a guiding method and a BPM that you prefer, and then complete three trials under the three different Alpha levels. (We suggest to start with BPM=60, Alpha=High,with both audio and visual guidance  )

If you encounter any difficulties in completing the experiment requirements, each trial will end after running for 3 minutes. After it ends, you can start a new trial.

Have a good day! (*^â–½^*)
